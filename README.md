Inspired by the alignment chart, this is originally my custom way of rolling stats for characters.  Instead of 4d6x6 (24d6) you just roll 9d6.
Like:  The player rolls a d6 9 times (rerolling ones) and places the results in the dark grid per the players choice,  The lighter bits on the side and bottom add the totals of the rows and columns, creating the stats for STG, DEX, ect., and the lightest corner is the overall sum of the dark grid.
Basically, less dice to roll and a mini strategy game as you place your rolls on the grid.  Also, you could assign the rows and columns to specific stats, adding to the strategy.
